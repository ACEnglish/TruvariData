For each of the 1kb regions - I look to see if there's 
- truvari anno trf INS
I then look at how many copies of a repeat and the TRFDiff (same signal).

Imagine repeat REP, The reference holds 4 copies. It has expansions to +1-+3 copies (i.e. 5, 6, 7 copies).

We want to count: how many representations (V) of each of the copies (C) that result in a difference (D) there are
across merge method (m <(e, t, j, s, n)):

| C | D | eV | tV | jV | sV | nV |
| --|---|----|----|----|----|----|
| 5 | 1 |  2 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  1 |
| 6 | 2 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  1 |  0 |
| 7 | 3 |  2 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  0 |

So, in this toy example, we can see that exact merge (eV) had redundant representations of the 5 and 7 copy (+1/+3)
variants. Truvari kept one representation of each, and the others 'over collapsed' at least one of the representations
into another.

Now, how can I turn this into math?
