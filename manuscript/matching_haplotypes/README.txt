- Per-haplotype bench to GIAB HG002

bash per_hap_bench.sh hg19.fa giab.vcf.gz giab.include.bed NA24385.exact.intramerge.vcf.gz

- Simplest case of SV merging

bash simplest_case.sh hg19.fa NA24385.exact.intramerge.vcf.gz

- Figure2:
Script to make the dataframe (I think I already have it), but it might be too big
Clean Intra-Sample notebook


- Exact count and haplotype comparison
% similarity and stuff
Need to make that data

- Three merges against GIAB HG002
Just make dataframes
Then table maker

- All 36 Samples, Average per-sample, reference views
Het/Hom Ratios
